# You are given an m x n matrix. Your task is to determine if the matrix has diagonal stripes where all elements in each diagonal from top-left to bottom-right are of the same stripeâ€”that is, they are identical.

# In this context, each diagonal stripe runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix. Check if every diagonal stripe consists entirely of the same number.

# Return True if all diagonal stripes are of the same stripe, otherwise return False.

# Example #1

# Input: matrix = [[42, 7, 13, 99], [6, 42, 7, 13], [1, 6, 42, 7]]

# Output: True

# Explanation:
# In this grid, the diagonals are:

# [1]
# [6, 6]
# [42, 42, 42]
# [7, 7, 7]
# [13, 13]
# [99]
# All elements in each diagonal ar identical. Thus, the answer is True.

# Example #2
# Input: matrix = [[8, 23], [69, 1]]

# Output: False

# Explanation:
# The diagonal [8, 1] does not consist of elements of the same stripe.
